# Automatic-cards-seller-gachapon-bot-discord

This program is easy to use and a little intuitive.

Probably it gonna lose its importance once they integrate a way to sell bulk of cards with a tag, but for now it could be useful for someone else.

# Information-beforehand

This program its just like auto clicker but made in python, so while the program its on use you dont want to move or write anything to mess up the process.

To comprehend what to put in the program, on first hand you should already have been used the command of gsell on gachapon bot and successfully sold a card on it.

# Instructions-how-to-use-it

First we have the interface.

In the textbox is where you gonna put all your cards number, wich you use when you put on gsell.

It should look like this.

Its very important you copy the numbers just like it gives you the bot.

Just click the middle button and you get the numbers like its in the previous image.

Afterward you click in the sort button, that its necessary to be in descendant form so it doesnt sell a different card you want.

Just like this.

The rest is easy, just select in what currency you want to sell the card(as a reminder if you select all currencies available, the last one you selected just gonna be that currency it gonna be sold), in time you use the same format when you sell the card as well to value.

# Troubleshooting

This program its not perfect so some problems may you can encounter while you use it, i will say some i encounter and mostly at fault for the ping of response of the bot.

1. It got stuck while it was writing the values of the card.

     Check the files in images coincide with the one on your discord, if not take a screenshot that coincide with you discord and replace the image with the same name it had.
   
3. It got stuck trying to click confirm after it wrote all values.
   
     Most probably the bot its down, you need to wait ones response so you just click confirm or it was to late then you need start from beginning.
   
4. The program just start missing the button yes to sell the card.
   
     You need to reduce the window of discord just enough to concentrate the buttons of the card.
   
5. The program it just start selling cards i didnt want to.
   
     Its your fault for no checking when your cards returned from gsell or you was trading with someone and mess up the order of the cards or you buy a card on bid. but there is a solution, you can move the mouse to the left corner inferior to stop the program, but with this you need to start from beggining.

# Warning

I dont have plan to update the program any near in the future.

Any use of the program relays on you, and any consequences you get from use of the program its up to you.
